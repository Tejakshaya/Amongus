<span style="color:red">I made this repository for one reason only...............................................................................[here it is](https://github.com/Adatta1276/Among-Us-JS-Edition/tree/master/docs/why-i-made.md)</span>.


I was a bit bored of making small, normal projects, so I just wondered if I could do this challenge, and I started doing it. 

**Trust me, it is(not) easyðŸ˜¦ðŸ˜¬**

And I'm still doing it

```By the way, all contributions are WELCOME.```
